About Me!
        "Hi, I’m Abarna, a dedicated Computer Science Engineering student at 
K. Ramakrishnan College of Technology in Tiruchirappalli, where I’ve maintained a 
CGPA of 8.60. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for 
problem-solving. I specialize in Python and Java, and I’ve had the opportunity to 
develop a range of projects, such as a Milk Price Calculator and a Weather 
Detection Application, and even a Virtual Assistant using machine learning. I’m 
passionate about staying ahead in the tech world, which is why I’ve pursued various 
certifications, including those from TCS ION and NASSCOM, to enhance my skills.

Beyond academics, I’ve gained practical experience through internships 
at KAAR Technology and Salesforce, where I worked on cloud computing and 
software development projects that helped me understand the industry better. I’m 
also proud of my versatility, as I’m fluent in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada, 
which helps me connect with a diverse range of people. In addition to my technical 
work, I’ve actively participated in extracurricular activities, such as competing in 
district-level carrom championships, where I secured second place.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to 
innovative projects, collaborate with dynamic teams, and contribute to creating 
impactful solutions in the tech industry. My goal is to continuously learn, grow, and 
make meaningful contributions to the field of software development."
